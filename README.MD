# Automated Data Pipeline & Synchronization Audit System

An advanced, lightweight Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data synchronization system designed to operate efficiently within localized terminal environments (including Linux/Termux). This project automates seamless data processing, API interactions, and live data integrity checks.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Automated Data ETL:** Extracts high-volume raw data, transforms it through strict processing pipelines, and structures it into optimized formats.
* **Live Integration:** Seamless connection with external storage layers, remote APIs, and dynamic spreadsheet synchronization.
* **Comprehensive Audit Engine:** Built-in error logging and data integrity validation to prevent telemetry gaps or overlapping data entries.
* **Environment Agnostic:** Fully optimized to run as a reliable command-line background utility via Termux on Android or remote Linux servers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
* **Core Language:** Python 3.x
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub Workflow
* **Environment:** Linux CLI / Termux Terminal
* **Data Formatting:** JSON, JSONL, and Structured Data Formats
